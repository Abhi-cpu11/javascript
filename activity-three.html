<!--The three ppl who reviewed my thing are nihal, Ibrahim, and Charan.
Regarding my feedback my madlib is good said by Charan Gambhir, he said " the story is creative
".He didnt notice any flaws in my madlib that he saw.
Nihal said the good thing it works and looks appealing. The bad thing is the prompt he put in didn't make sense but 
that is because he might inputed the wrong prompts..
The overall feedback was positive, they liked the creativity and the structure of the madlib.
The things I learned so far about JavaScript is ? -->
