1. The three ppl who reviewed my website are Nihal, Dana,
and Charan.

2. Regarding my feedback my madlib is good said by Charan Gambhir, he said " the story is creative
".He didnt notice any flaws in my madlib that he expcitly noticed..
Nihal said the good thing is it works and looks appealing. The bad thing is the prompt he put in didn't make sense but 
that is because he might inputed the wrong prompts eg putting name for the food prompt.
Dana said is clear and very funny. The bad thing is its very annoying.
The overall feedback was mid, they liked the creativity and the structure of the madlib.
Meanhwile some found it a bit annoying on the constant info you have to give 
or confusing depending on how the prompts were used.It works though. 

3. Oh my JavaScript, where should I start from. 
First, I learned how to use prompts to get answers from people
and turn it into a simple Mad Lib story. Then we made buttons 
that could change the text on the page, switch pictures, and 
even change how something looks like the font or color. 
I also learned how to make a live clock that updates every 
second and a vote counter that goes up when you click it (Nihal).
Itâ€™s actually crazy how much you can do with just a bit of code.
